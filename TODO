-- Add proper Makefile
-- Add a framework to run test conveniently (use one from lua-nucleo)
-- See TODOs in lua-phpserialize.c
-- Code must fit in 80 chars width
-- Reuse code from lua-nucleo in util.{c,h}
-- Prepend all preprocessor definitions (except L* checkers) with LPHPSERIALIZE_
-- Backport some good practice from luabins.
-- That is_float_finite definition is a bit scary. Think out more a legal way.
